# MLM-Management-App

This project is created with the purpose of managing the distributors in a MLM system in mind, with basic features being: adding distributors to the system, deleting a distributor, calculating the commission of each distributors, along with the sum of every distributors' commission. You can also check the information of distributors through a search button on the top right corner of the app.

## Requirements

In the process of developing this MLM Management App, I have make use of these tools:

- Python (version 3.10.0 and above). As for the GUI, I used Tkinter Designer, which helped me to turn my design from Figma into a full-fledged GUI in Python.

- Supabase
- Cloudinary
- Git
